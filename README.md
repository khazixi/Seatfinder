# UMass Seatfinder

Umass Seatfinder aims to make it easy to share your
seating location in any of UMass' 4 main dining halls.

## Goals

I want to make the experience of locating yourself easy and quick.
I want every interaction to feel super fast and locating yourself 
to feel super intuitive.

## Contributing

If there are any issues that you believe you can fix with the app logic wise
file a pull request so I can review and fix it. If you are contributing assets
you can either file a pull request on github or email me and I will update the
assets on the website for you.
